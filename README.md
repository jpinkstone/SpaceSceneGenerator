# SpaceSceneGenerator
This program randomly creates space-like scenes that can be downloaded as desktop background images. Every render is completely unique and different, allowing for interesting designs.

The program was created in Unity and all project files are in the repository. Please feel free to pull the Unity files and add/edit the program!
